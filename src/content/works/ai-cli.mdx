AI-CLI is a Command Line Interface (CLI) that enables you to interact with Language Learning Models (LLMs) directly from your terminal. With various working modes and flexible features, AI-CLI is designed to simplify tasks such as translation, summarization, code generation, and more.

## Key Features

* **Direct LLM Interaction:** Interact with LLMs directly from the terminal.
* **Multiple Working Modes:** Supports various working modes for different tasks.
* **High Flexibility:** Designed to be flexible and easily customizable.
* **REST API Integration:** Uses my own REST API [Ezy API](https://ezy.side.my.id/) for LLM interaction.
* **Diverse Tasks:** Simplifies tasks like translation, summarization, code generation, and more.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The programming language used for the CLI.
* **Click:** For creating the command-line interface.
* **Requests:** For making HTTP requests to the REST API.
* **certifi:** Provides certificate authority data.
* **charset-normalizer:** Character encoding normalizer.
* **colorama:** Cross-platform colored terminal text.
* **idna:** Internationalized Domain Names in Applications.
* **pyperclip:** Cross-platform clipboard functions.
* **urllib3:** HTTP library.
