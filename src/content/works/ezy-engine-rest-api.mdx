EzyAPI is a user-friendly, free API platform with a relaxed yet functional approach. Built with modern technologies, EzyAPI aims to simplify interactions with advanced AI models like Claude, GPT, and Gemini, while also providing various useful features for application development.

**Note:** This API is still under development because, well... the admin is currently in a "mager" phase (Indonesian slang for being too lazy to code). So, please enjoy our placeholder humor while waiting for updates. 

## Key Features

* **AI Model Endpoints:** Access to advanced AI models like Claude, GPT, and Gemini.
* **Universal Download Endpoints:** Download content from various social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, X, Threads, Rednote/Xiaohongshu).
* **File Upload Endpoint:** Upload files to the API.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Full API documentation available at [ezy.side.my.id](https://ezy.side.my.id/).

## API Endpoint

* Base URL: [https://api.side.my.id](https://api.side.my.id)

## Development Status 

Why isn't EzyAPI fully functional yet?

* Reason #1: The admin is in a "mager" phase (laziness). Ô∏è
* Reason #2: Creative procrastination is an art. 

Please be patient as we are slowly but surely working on making EzyAPI the coolest API platform you'll ever use. In the meantime, just enjoy our lazy excuses.
